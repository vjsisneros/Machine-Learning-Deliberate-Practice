# Machine Learning Deliberate Practice

*“This is a fundamental truth about any sort of practice: If you never push yourself beyond your comfort zone, you will never improve.”  

― Anders Ericsson, Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise*


## The purpose of this project is to improve my Machine Learning skills by implementing algorithms on datasets. This is a record of my progress.
