# Machine Learning Deliberate Practice

“This is a fundamental truth about any sort of practice: If you never push yourself beyond your comfort zone, you will never improve.”  

― Anders Ericsson, Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise


The purpose of this project is to improve my Machine Learning skills by implementing algorithms on datasets. This is a record of my progress.
